[![OSS Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack?color=success)](https://github.com/honeycombio/home/blob/main/honeycomb-oss-lifecycle-and-practices.md)
[![CI](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/actions/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/actions?query=Test%20Terraform%20Module)

This module creates resources like Derived Columns, Saved Queries, and Boards in [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) to kick off exploration of OpenTelemetry data in your environment

## Use

The minimal config necessary for this module to run requires nothing other than the `source` for calling the module.  All other options are optional, so the minimum config for this module is the below code, and setting the `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` environment variable:

```hcl
module "explore-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack" {
  source = "honeycombio/opentelemetry-starter-pack/honeycombio"
}
```

Set the API key used by Terraform setting the HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY
```

Now you can run `terraform init/plan/apply` in sequence.

For more config options,
see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/blob/main/USAGE.md)
.

## Examples

Examples of use of this module can be found
in [`examples/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/tree/main/examples)
. We've
provided an example using some of the possible options that the module has with non-default values.

## Development

### Tests

Test cases that run against local code are
in [`tests/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/tree/main/tests)
. To set up:

1. Set the API key used by Terraform setting the HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.
2. `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will now work as expected, as will
   `terraform destroy`.
3. Test cases also run as part of the pipeline.
   See [test-terraform-module.yml](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml)

### Docs

Docs are autogenerated via `./docs.sh`, and put
in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-opentelemetry-starter-pack/blob/main/USAGE.md)
. Please
regenerate and commit before merging.

### Lints

We use [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) and `terraform
fmt`, and enforce this with a [github action](.github/workflows/tflint.yml).
