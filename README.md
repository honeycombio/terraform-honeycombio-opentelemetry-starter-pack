HOW TO SETUP A MODULE: NEXT STEPS: DELETE ME
==================================

* Review the generated repo: the Terraform code will be added in the root (can start with main.tf -
  see [TF docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/develop) for more details)


* To run terraform and test the module locally: you can add / create config in the `tests/` directory


* Please update `examples/` & the README when ready (find and replace FIXME)


* Run ./docs.sh to generate Terraform Docs for your module


* **Create and Add
  required [SECRETS](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/settings/secrets/actions)
  for the Github Workflows to run:**
  * Add HONEYCOMB_API_KEY that has the required permissions


* Open PRs, review, merge!


* See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) when ready to Release


* Once a GitHub Release is published - Navigate to the Terraform Registry to publish the new module via the UI
  * This is done **once** - this in turn sets up a **webhook** that will keep the module up to date on subsequent
    releases

[![CI](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/actions/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/actions?query=Test%20Terraform%20Module)

This module creates resources like FIXME in [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) to kick off exploration

## Use

The minimal config is:

```hcl
module "explore-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack" {
  source = "honeycombio/golden-otel-starter-pack/honeycombio"
  #FIXME 
}
```

Set the API key used by Terraform setting the HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY
```

Now you can run `terraform plan/apply` in sequence.

For more config options,
see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/blob/main/USAGE.md)
.

## Examples

Examples of use of this module can be found
in [`examples/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/tree/main/examples)
. We've
provided a build durations exploration example.

## Development

### Tests

Test cases that run against local code are
in [`tests/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/tree/main/tests)
. To set up:

1. Set the API key used by Terraform setting the HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.

3. `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will now work as expected, as will
   `terraform destroy`.

4. Test cases also run as part of the pipeline.
   See [test-terraform-module.yml](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml)

### Docs

Docs are autogenerated via `./docs.sh`, and put
in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-honeycombio-golden-otel-starter-pack/blob/main/USAGE.md)
. Please
regenerate and commit before merging.

### Lints

We use [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) and `terraform
fmt`, and enforce this with a [github action](.github/workflows/tflint.yml).
